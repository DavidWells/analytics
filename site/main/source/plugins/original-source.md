subTitle: Using the original src plugin

Track the initial traffic source of visitors to your site.

This plugin will save the original referral source of visitors and the first page they came in on.

The following values are saved to localStorage:

- `__user_original_source`
- `__user_original_landing_page`

These pieces of information can be very useful when assigning attribution data to users.

**Example:**

```
__user_original_source = "source=(direct)|medium=(none)|campaign=(not set)"
__user_original_landing_page = "https://www.site.com/landing-page"
```

## How to use

Install the plugins from npm.

```bash
npm install analytics
npm install @analytics/original-source-plugin
```

Then include it in your `analytics` instance

```js
import Analytics from 'analytics'
import originalSourcePlugin from '@analytics/original-source-plugin'

const analytics = Analytics({
  app: 'my-app',
  version: 100,
  debug: true,
  plugins: [
    originalSourcePlugin(),
  ]
})
```
